			<p>Yes that's right! This bot takes songs which are currently sexist toward women, and makes them sexist toward men! You may be asking yourself, "Well where does this get us??" The answer is no where! But that's okay, because this is stupid and it's fun!</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Submit your song and enjoy the now shittily produced sexist lyrics. As an added bonus you can download the bot monotonously speaking your lyrics. Enjoy!</p>
