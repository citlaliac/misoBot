# misoBot
misoBot, or misaBot is a little baby robot that needs your help converting song's pronouns. Misa/o-bot is a portmanteau of misogony or misandry and robot, it takes any song sexist against one sex, and playfully changes it to dispare the opposite. misoBot's goal is to provide perspective- to put folks in someone else's shoes. Now complete with lyric change and text to speech ability, misoBot is a funny little robot with a tiny, doofus brain. As it stands, misoBot's dictionary (how it converts pronouns) is small, and weak, but you can help! Add to the repo, fork it up, or just clone it and make your own. 

TO USE misoBot - download and run in a python capable IDE then...
  1. Upload your song lyrics into the "misoSongTest" (soon to be misoSong*Text*)
  2. Run "misoLogic"
  3. Open "misoOutput"
  3. That's uhh... that's kinda it, *unless* you want to HEAR those lyrics """sung""" to you. You do? 
  4. Run "gttsTest"
  5. Open "good" and listen to that sultrly voice caress your eardrums.
